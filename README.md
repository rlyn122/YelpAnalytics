# YelpAnalytics
 Analyzing food trends and regional cuisines through Yelp Open Dataset
Checkout our visual essay: https://rlyn122.github.io/YelpAnalytics/


 We explored three different types of analysis:
 1. Topic Modeling
 2. Top Adjectives
 3. TF-IDF Scores

Our research will investigate how a food businessâ€™ cuisine influences the type of reviews written by its consumers. We hypothesize that racial stereotypes will be reflected in both the positive and negative reviews. For example, we believe that Chinese restaurants have more negative comments about staff and cleanliness, as well as more positive comments about the cost of the food. Japanese restaurants will have more positive comments about staff and cleanliness, but more negative comments about its cost.
