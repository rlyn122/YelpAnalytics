                <h2>Setup: Hypothesis and Goals</h2>

                <p>Our research will investigate how cuisine influences the type of adjectives and words
                    that
                    consumers use
                    across four different cuisines: <strong> Chinese, American, Mexican, and Japanese </strong>. Our
                    project
                    has centered
                    around the question of customers' expectations about various food cuisines. We ask the question:
                </p>
                <em>
                    <p>How does cuisine impact the adjectives used for reviews? </p>
                </em>
                <p>
                    <strong>We hypothesized that because of consumer biases,
                        racial
                        stereotypes will be reflected in both positive and negative Yelp reviews </strong>. This would
                    be observed by
                    specifically high use of adjectives to
                    that target a certain cuisine. For example, racial biases might increase the use of certain words to discuss qualities of a business such as cost, taste of
                    food, service and more. The goal of this project is to uncover these trends.

                <h2>Dataset Used: Yelp Open Dataset</h2>
                <p>Using Yelp as our main dataset for customer reviews
                    in restaurants all over the country, we filtered data to include all restaurants with more than ten reviews into four
                    separate categories: American, Chinese, Mexican, and Japanese restaurants. All other samples that
                    did
                    not fit in any of these categories were discarded. Despite cutting out restaurants that did not fit
                    our
                    criteria, we still wound up with a huge sample: 590,000 reviews for American restaurants, 52,000 for
                    Chinese restaurants, 126,000 for Mexican restaurants, and 39,000 for Japanese restaurants, amounting
                    to
                    more than 800,000 reviews.
                </p>
                <p>We used<strong> three main methods of analysis:</strong>

                    <li>Top Adjectives</li>

                <h2>Analysis 1: Topic Modeling</h2>

                <p> Our first method of analysis was <strong>topic modeling</strong>. Using the NLTK (Natural Language Tool Kit) in python, we
                    first processed
                    out stop words and filtered the data. Next we used Gensim's LDA (Latent Direchlet Allocation) model
                    to do topic modeling. In short, an LDA is a supervised machine learning model that allows us to extract
                    popular topics from a given corpus.</p>

                <p>
                    As we were obtaining the data, we discovered that the way in which we grouped our documents to
                    create
                    a
                    corpus had a strong impact on the results of the model.

                    We tried various groupings of documents, specifically grouping by review, rating, restaurant,
                    and
                    combinations of each, obtaining a different set of results each time we submitted the data. Despite
                    obtaining a variety of varying results, we couldn’t find any extremely significant patterns. The
                    most interesting result, however, came about by grouping documents by the rating in each cusine.
                    Below you can see two examples of outputs of the topic model when grouping documents by review
                    rating. The number associated represent the weight of the word.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Japanese Reviews</h2>
                    <img id="topicImg" src="./images/japanese_byRating.png">
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Mexican Reviews</h2>
                    <img id="topicImg" src="./images/mexican_byRating.png">
                </div>



                <p>
                    Much of the results was filled with neutral words and food items, slang, or
                    foreign
                    language. In the Mexican results you can see the words “chipilon”, "yumm", "merrch", and “messikin.” 
                    This made it evident there was still unnecessary clutter in the data, but you can see some promising
                    results in these. For example, Topic 0 in Japanese reviews talks about cockroaches and puke.
                    Additionally the Topic 4 in Mexican reviews discusses racism, liars, and livid. Ideally, we would be
                    able to attribute specific words that are used to describe specific cuisines. Below, we show results
                    for topic modeling Chinese and American cuisines.
                </p>
                <h2>Chinese Reviews</h2>
                <div>
                    <img id="topicImg" src="./images/chinese_byRating.png">
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>American Reviews</h2>
                    <img id="topicImg" src="./images/american_byRating.png">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Negative themes emerge when looking through the reviews collected for Chinese and American restaurants. For instance, in Topic 4 concerning Chinese cuisine, criticisms focus on poor service and location, describing the restaurant staff and venue as rude, disrespectful, and moldy. Interestingly, certain unusual words like "metropolitan," "fox," and "reuben" appear, seemingly out of place. This could be due to a significant number of poor reviews coming from restaurants that serve fusion food, a common practice in Chinese restaurants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The prevalence of mentions of cockroaches and vomit across Chinese and Japanese cuisine topics suggests that the venues are not unkept well, with hygiene not being a priority. 
This is a serious concern as food poisoning due to unsanitary conditions could occur, and could lose the restaraunt business. Regardless, this did meet our hypothesis,
 as the common stereotype of labeling Asian restaurants and food
 as dirty is shown to be prevalent in these reviews. Notably, there is no topic that us strongly negative about cleanliness in either Mexican or American Topic Model results.
    Whether or not Chinese and Japanese restaraunts are simply more dirty than American and Mexican restaraunts, we do not know but is unlikely. 
    Therefore, the prevalence of these topics of cleanliness in Asian cuisines <strong> does not quite confirm </strong> the presence of Asian stereotypes in cuisine reviews but it is a good sign of evidence for it.
    Additionally, results may be influenced by inherent biases of the Yelp Dataset and in this sense, jumping to strong conclusions should be avoided.
</p>
<p>
In American reviews, the validity of topic modeling is questionable due to the presence of many non-words or non-English terms. However, Topic 4 stands out for its exploration of negative terms such as "abusing," "racists," and "pba." References to "beer" and "racists" epitomize American stereotypes. While the data presents interesting insights, we found that topic modeling did not reveal sufficiently clear and decisive trends. Therefore, we pursued an alternative analysis method: examining top adjective counts.

                <h2>Analysis 2: Top Adjectives</h2>
                <p>Top adjectives is simple. Instead of a complex machine learning algorithm, we can just search for the most frequent adjectives in each rating category. We thought this might be a more simple and intuitive way to search for racial stereotype biases.</p>
                <p>We decide to search for all top adjectives. At first, we filtered out the data to get all adjectives, but when running the top adjectives algorithm, we got "good" as the
                    overwhelmingly top used adjective for every rating across almost every cuisine. Therefore we
                    decided to manually filter out non-descriptive words such as good, great, nice, much ... After running the model again, we got slightly more interesting results: </p>

                <p>In our analysis of Top Adjectives results, we observed intriguing patterns in how customers mentioned

                    cuisine
                    of restaurants in their reviews. The term 'Chinese' emerged as the most frequently used descriptor
                    for
                    food and service across all five ratings for Chinese restaurants, except in 5-star reviews where
                    'Chinese' was the second most common term, with 'Delicious' taking the top spot.

                    Similarly, Mexican
                    restaurants followed a comparable trend, with 'Mexican' either being the most or second most
                    utilized
                    term in customer reviews across all ratings.

                <p>
                    Reviews of Japanese restaurants frequently included the term 'Japanese' among the top 10 most used
                    words
                    across various ratings. Conversely, terms like "American" or "Western" were not prevalent
                    descriptors
                    for American cuisine in the reviews. Given that most of our sample was from American restaurants, it
                    suggests that such terms may be considered redundant since Western and American food are often
                    perceived
                    as the norm in this context. However, this observation also underscores the phenomenon of 'othering'
                    when discussing cuisines from cultures outside of America.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another pattern we noticed from the Top Adjectives results is that, of all the various elements of a
                    restaurant,
                    the taste of the food seems to be the most important. Terms such as ‘delicious’ and ‘fresh’ were
                    constantly used throughout all cuisines and all ratings, which was surprising to us. We imagined
                    terms
                    describing the restaurants’ cleanliness and customer service to be as frequent as terms describing
                    the
                    food. Admittedly, customer service is mentioned quite a bit, especially in the more extreme reviews
                    (1
                    and 5-star ratings) with terms such as “rude” and “friendly,” but food was mentioned 2-4 times more
                    than
                    the other factors.
                </p>
                <p>Not all graphs were included for brevity and results were fairly similar, but all graphs can be

                </p>

                <p>Top Adjectives again did not get enough descriptive words that we were searching for to confirm
                    stereotype and biases in reviews, so we tried TF-IDF analysis.</p>

                <h2>Analysis 3: TF-IDF Analysis</h2>
                <p> TF-IDF analysis is a way of measuring the significance of each word by its TF (Term frequency) and
                    IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) score. This method of analysis adjusts for the fact that some words
                    appear more frequent than others. We thought that since Top-Adjectives was not able to capture our,
                    perhaps TF-IDF scores would be able to capture more significant words about racial stereotypes.</p>

                    Above we show the top 10 TF-IDF scores for all four cuisines with rating 1. As you can see, the data is not super interesting. 
                    All the graphs share commonalities, in that the top words include, worst, last, terrible, horrible, and rude. Seemingly, for the most part, 
                    the graphs just confirm the language used to talk negatively in general.

                    The most notable trend again, is that the top word for Chinese cuisines in TF-IDF scores was "Chinese" and the second highest word for Mexican cuisine was "Mexican". 
                    Other than this, these results seem pretty inconclusive. Below we show the top 10 TF-IDF scores for the 5 star rating.

                <p>In the 5 star-ratings for different cuisines, delicious was by far the most significant word. This shows the importnace of taste
                    to reviews. For Mexican and Chinese cuisines, "Mexican" and "Chinese" were again very significant words. Service is also extremely important
                    as "friendly" is a common top word for all restaraunts. 
                    Another notable point is that "authentic" is important in the top 10 TF-IDF scores for only the Mexican cuisine.

                    Overall, the TFIDF graphs did not get the information
                    about stereotypes that we were searching for. We are searching for ways to better run our TF-IDF analyses.

                <p>Again, not all graphs were included for brevity because results were fairly similar, but all graphs
                    for TFIDF analysis
                    can be

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p> In conclusion, our initial data showed some promising patterns
                    as we were able to identify possible implicit biases in commonly used customer critiques (cleanliness) for Chinese and Japanese restaurants. 
                    Additionally, we discovered the potential of ‘othering of businesses that sell products that are not American. 
                     With further cleaning and optimisation of the groupings, we would be able to find more conclusive data for our project.
                    
                                        
                    </p>
                    <p>In the future, we are specifically interested in pursuing the top adjectives model but grouping texts by subject, specifically cleanliness.
                        Since we got promising results from our topic model analyses that suggested Chinese and Japanese restaraunts were dirty, 
                        we can try to explore this by <strong>quantifying top adjectives about cleanliness </strong> to better understand if this 
                        bias truly exists. For example, we would like to see
                        what are all the top adjectives in only reviews about service or cleanliness. This will require more complex preprocessing and data filtering.
                        We recognize that this research is far from done, and plan to continue searchign for stereotypes!
