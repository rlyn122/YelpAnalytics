                <h2>Setup: Hypothesis and Goals</h2>

                <p>Our research will investigate how cuisine influences the type of adjectives and words
                    that
                    consumers use
                    across four different cuisines: <strong> Chinese, American, Mexican, and Japanese </strong>. Our
                    project
                    has centered
                    around the question of customers' expectations about various food cuisines. We ask the question:
                </p>
                <em>
                    <p>How does cuisine impact the adjectives used for reviews? </p>
                </em>
                <p>
                    Before we obtained the results, <strong>we hypothesized that because of consumer expectations,
                        racial
                        stereotypes will be reflected in both positive and negative Yelp reviews </strong>. This would
                    arise
                    with
                    adjectives being used to describe the cleanliness of businesses (where typical Chinese and
                    Mexican
                    businesses are less appealing to Americans than Japanese ones, for example), cost, taste of
                    food, and
                    staff behavior.

                <h2>Dataset Used: Yelp Open Dataset</h2>
                <p>Using Yelp as our main dataset for customer reviews
                    in restaurants all over the country, we grouped restaurants with more than ten reviews into four
                    separate categories: American, Chinese, Mexican, and Japanese restaurants. All other samples that
                    did
                    not fit in any of these categories were discarded. Despite cutting out restaurants that did not fit
                    our
                    criteria, we still wound up with a huge sample: 590,000 reviews for American restaurants, 52,000 for
                    Chinese restaurants, 126,000 for Mexican restaurants, and 39,000 for Japanese restaurants, amounting
                    to
                    more than 800,000 reviews.
                </p>
                <p>We used<strong> three main methods of analysis:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Topic Modeling</li>
                    <li>Top Adjectives</li>
                    <li>TF-IDF Scores</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Analysis 1: Topic Modeling</h2>
                <p>As we were obtaining the data, we discovered that the way in which we grouped our documents to create
                    a
                    corpus had an impact on the results of the model. We grouped our data by review, rating, restaurant,
                    and
                    combinations of each, obtaining a different set of results each time we submitted the data. Despite
                    obtaining a variety of varying results, we couldn’t find any significant patterns or anything that
                    stood
                    out. Much of the results was filled with neutral words such as “burger” or “tacos” or slang and
                    foreign
                    language words like “chipilon” and “messikin.” We wanted to focus on the adjectives, and cleaned out
                    all
                    the unnecessary clutter before running the data through again.

                <h2>Analysis 3: TF-IDF Analysis</h2>
                <p>In our analysis of TF-IDF results, we observed intriguing patterns in how customers mentioned the
                    cuisine
                    of restaurants in their reviews. The term 'Chinese' emerged as the most frequently used descriptor
                    for
                    food and service across all five ratings for Chinese restaurants, except in 5-star reviews where
                    'Chinese' was the second most common term, with 'Delicious' taking the top spot. Similarly, Mexican
                    restaurants followed a comparable trend, with 'Mexican' either being the most or second most
                    utilized
                    term in customer reviews across all ratings.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Reviews of Japanese restaurants frequently included the term 'Japanese' among the top 10 most used
                    words
                    across various ratings. Conversely, terms like "American" or "Western" were not prevalent
                    descriptors
                    for American cuisine in the reviews. Given that most of our sample was from American restaurants, it
                    suggests that such terms may be considered redundant since Western and American food are often
                    perceived
                    as the norm in this context. However, this observation also underscores the phenomenon of 'othering'
                    when discussing cuisines from cultures outside of America.
                    Our next step involves collecting data on European cuisines to explore potential differences in
                    customer
                    reviews and further understand how different culinary backgrounds are perceived and described in
                    restaurant feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another pattern we noticed from the TF-IDF results is that, of all the various elements of a
                    restaurant,
                    the taste of the food seems to be the most important. Terms such as ‘delicious’ and ‘fresh’ were
                    constantly used throughout all cuisines and all ratings, which was surprising to us. We imagined
                    terms
                    describing the restaurants’ cleanliness and customer service to be as frequent as terms describing
                    the
                    food. Admittedly, customer service is mentioned quite a bit, especially in the more extreme reviews
                    (1
                    and 5-star ratings) with terms such as “rude” and “friendly,” but food was mentioned 2-4 times more
                    than
                    the other factors.
