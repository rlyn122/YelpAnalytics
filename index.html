                <h2>Setup: Hypothesis and Goals</h2>

                <p>Our research will investigate how cuisine influences the type of adjectives and words
                    that
                    consumers use
                    across four different cuisines: <strong> Chinese, American, Mexican, and Japanese </strong>. Our
                    project
                    has centered
                    around the question of customers' expectations about various food cuisines. We ask the question:
                </p>
                <em>
                    <p>How does cuisine impact the adjectives used for reviews? </p>
                </em>
                <p>
                    Before we obtained the results, <strong>we hypothesized that because of consumer expectations,
                        racial
                        stereotypes will be reflected in both positive and negative Yelp reviews </strong>. This would
                    arise
                    with
                    adjectives being used to describe the cleanliness of businesses (where typical Chinese and
                    Mexican
                    businesses are less appealing to Americans than Japanese ones, for example), cost, taste of
                    food, and
                    staff behavior.

                <h2>Dataset Used: Yelp Open Dataset</h2>
                <p>Using Yelp as our main dataset for customer reviews
                    in restaurants all over the country, we grouped restaurants with more than ten reviews into four
                    separate categories: American, Chinese, Mexican, and Japanese restaurants. All other samples that
                    did
                    not fit in any of these categories were discarded. Despite cutting out restaurants that did not fit
                    our
                    criteria, we still wound up with a huge sample: 590,000 reviews for American restaurants, 52,000 for
                    Chinese restaurants, 126,000 for Mexican restaurants, and 39,000 for Japanese restaurants, amounting
                    to
                    more than 800,000 reviews.
                </p>
                <p>We used<strong> three main methods of analysis:</strong>
                <ol>

                    <li>Top Adjectives</li>

                <h2>Analysis 1: Topic Modeling</h2>

                <p> Our first method of analysis was <strong>topic modeling</strong>. Using natural language tool it, we
                    first processed
                    out stop words and filtered the data. Next we used Gensim's LDA (Latent Direchlet Allocation) model
                    to do topic modeling. An LDA is a supervised machine learning model that allows us to extract
                    popular topics from a given corpus.</p>

                <p>
                    As we were obtaining the data, we discovered that the way in which we grouped our documents to
                    create
                    a
                    corpus had a strong impact on the results of the model.

                    We tried various groupings of documents, specifically grouping by review, rating, restaurant,
                    and
                    combinations of each, obtaining a different set of results each time we submitted the data. Despite
                    obtaining a variety of varying results, we couldn’t find any extremely significant patterns. The
                    most interesting result, however, came about by grouping documents by the rating in each cusine.
                    Below you can see two examples of outputs of the topic model when grouping documents by review
                    rating. The number associated represent the weight of the word.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Japanese Reviews</h2>
                    <img id="topicImg" src="./images/japanese_byRating.png">
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Mexican Reviews</h2>
                    <img id="topicImg" src="./images/mexican_byRating.png">
                </div>



                <p>
                    Much of the results was filled with neutral words such as “burger” or “tacos” or slang and
                    foreign
                    language words like “chipilon” and “messikin.” We wanted to focus on the adjectives, and cleaned out
                    all
                    the unnecessary clutter before running the data through again, but you can see some promising
                    results in these. For example, Topic 0 in Japanese reviews talks about cockroaches and puke.
                    Additionally the Topic 4 in Mexican reviews discusses racism, liars, and livid. Ideally, we would be
                    able to attribute specific words that are used to describe specific cuisines. Below, we show results
                    for topic modeling Chinese and American cuisines.
                </p>
                <h2>Chinese Reviews</h2>
                <div>
                    <img id="topicImg" src="./images/chinese_byRating.png">
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>American Reviews</h2>
                    <img id="topicImg" src="./images/american_byRating.png">
                </div>
                <p>
                    In the Chinese and American reviews, you can see interesting negative topics as well. For example,
                    Topic
                    4 about Chinese cuisine demonstrates negativity about service and location calling restaraunts rude,
                    disrespected, and moldy. Notably, for some reason there seems to be alot of out of place words such
                    as
                    metropolitan, fox, or reuban. There seems to be a theme of cockroaches and puke for both Chinese and
                    Japanese cuisine. The American topic modeling is questionable as there seems to be many non-words or
                    non-English words, but Topic 4 is interesting in that it explores negative words such as abusing,
                    racists, and pba. Funny enough, beer and racists definetly represents an American stereotype!
                    Furthermore, calling Asian restaruants and food dirty is a common stereotype as well.
                    Although the data has some interesting points, we thought topic modeling did not show enough
                    decisive
                    and clear trends. Therefore, we tried another type of analysis: top adjective counts.

                <h2>Analysis 2: Top Adjectives</h2>
                <p>Top adjectives is simple, we just searched for the top used adjectives in each rating category. </p>
                <p>We decide to search for all top adjectives, but at first when running this, we got "good" as the
                    overwhelmingly top used adjectives for every rating across almost every cuisine. Therefore we
                    decided to manually filter out non-descriptive words such as good, great, nice, much ... </p>

                <p>In our analysis of Top Adjectives results, we observed intriguing patterns in how customers mentioned
                    the
                    cuisine
                    of restaurants in their reviews. The term 'Chinese' emerged as the most frequently used descriptor
                    for
                    food and service across all five ratings for Chinese restaurants, except in 5-star reviews where
                    'Chinese' was the second most common term, with 'Delicious' taking the top spot. Similarly, Mexican
                    restaurants followed a comparable trend, with 'Mexican' either being the most or second most
                    utilized
                    term in customer reviews across all ratings.

                </div>

                <p>
                    Reviews of Japanese restaurants frequently included the term 'Japanese' among the top 10 most used
                    words
                    across various ratings. Conversely, terms like "American" or "Western" were not prevalent
                    descriptors
                    for American cuisine in the reviews. Given that most of our sample was from American restaurants, it
                    suggests that such terms may be considered redundant since Western and American food are often
                    perceived
                    as the norm in this context. However, this observation also underscores the phenomenon of 'othering'
                    when discussing cuisines from cultures outside of America.
                    Our next step involves collecting data on European cuisines to explore potential differences in
                    customer
                    reviews and further understand how different culinary backgrounds are perceived and described in
                    restaurant feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another pattern we noticed from the Top Adjectives results is that, of all the various elements of a
                    restaurant,
                    the taste of the food seems to be the most important. Terms such as ‘delicious’ and ‘fresh’ were
                    constantly used throughout all cuisines and all ratings, which was surprising to us. We imagined
                    terms
                    describing the restaurants’ cleanliness and customer service to be as frequent as terms describing
                    the
                    food. Admittedly, customer service is mentioned quite a bit, especially in the more extreme reviews
                    (1
                    and 5-star ratings) with terms such as “rude” and “friendly,” but food was mentioned 2-4 times more
                    than
                    the other factors.
